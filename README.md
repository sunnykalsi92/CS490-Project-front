# CS490-Project-front
You are to create an online exam system.The only type of question  will be similar to the open ended programming questions on a CS 100 (Python) exam. In fact, all questions will be of the following form:  "Write a function named ___________ that takes the following arguments _____________ performs the following operations ______________ and returns the value."  For example, a typical question might be:  "Write a function named doubleIt that takes a single int argument and calculates twice the value of the input and returns that value."
